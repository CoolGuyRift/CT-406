# Homework 2 


This is the 2nd homework for CT-406. The tutorial used to create this project used the MVC way to create the webpage.
MVC stands for Model View Controller, and it's just a method in creating a website, an easy, straight forward one at that.
Probably the most difficult part of this assignment was incorporating SQL in there. If not for the tutorial, I would've been completely lost.
